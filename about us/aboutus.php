        <h1>About Graduate Nurse/Midwife Job Match</h1>
        <p>
            The Graduate Nurse/Midwife Job Match initiative, spearheaded by the University of Southern Queensland and in collaboration with industry leaders, aims to revolutionize the way nursing and midwifery graduates connect with employment opportunities across Australia. Focused primarily on supporting roles in regional, rural, and remote areas, this platform is designed to streamline the job search process, offering tailored, relevant, and accessible information.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our mission is driven by a deep understanding of the challenges faced by graduates in finding roles that align with their skills, preferences, and values. The platform not only facilitates job matching based on comprehensive criteria but also integrates essential tools and resources to empower graduates in making informed decisions.

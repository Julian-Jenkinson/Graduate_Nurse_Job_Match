- **MVC architecture** - Model View Controller (MVC) architecture

## Technology ðŸ’«
**Frontend** - some information

**Backend** - some information

## Deployment âœ¨
To deploy the prototype, I used an AWS S3 Bucket and an EC2 instance running NGINX for web hosting and SQL Server for database hosting. I have since deallocated these resources but the familiarity I gained from using AWS infastructure was invaluable.

## How to use this project ðŸ’¥
For local development, install XAMPP and phpmyadmin (included in XAMPP installation) to host and connect the web application. Accompanied is a database script file to initialise a dummy SQL database and should be run prior to using.

for XAMPP installation tips. See here:

Please note that the google API authentication key should be updated for the google maps, autocomplete and geocoded to work. Please enable the appropriate google APIs swell. This key can be updated in the view/header files. I have since deallocated this resources as there are minor fees attached.
